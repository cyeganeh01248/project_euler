<h1>Problem 860</h1>
<p>
    Gary and Sally play a game using gold and silver coins arranged into a
    number of vertical stacks, alternating turns. On Gary's turn he chooses a
    gold coin and removes it from the game along with any other coins sitting on
    top. Sally does the same on her turn by removing a silver coin. The first
    player unable to make a move loses.
</p>

<p>
    An arrangement is called <dfn>fair</dfn> if the person moving first, whether
    it be Gary or Sally, will lose the game if both play optimally.
</p>

<p>
    Define $F(n)$ to be the number of fair arrangements of $n$ stacks, all of
    size $2$. Different orderings of the stacks are to be counted separately, so
    $F(2) = 4$ due to the following four arrangements:

        alt="0860_diag3.jpg"
    />
</div>

<p>You are also given $F(10) = 63594$.</p>

<p>Find $F(9898)$. Give your answer modulo $989898989$</p>
