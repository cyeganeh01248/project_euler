A <i>pair</i> is a set of two cards of the same rank.</p>

<p>Cards are drawn, without replacement, from a well shuffled 52-card deck waiting for consecutive cards that form a pair. For example, the probability of finding a pair in the first two draws is $\frac{1}{17}$.</p>

<p>Cards are drawn until either such a pair is found or the pack is exhausted waiting for one. In the latter case we say that all 52 cards were drawn.</p>

<p>Find the expected number of cards that were drawn. Give your answer rounded to eight places after the decimal point.</p>
