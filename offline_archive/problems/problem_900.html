<h1>Problem 900</h1>
<p>
    Two players play a game with at least two piles of stones. The players
    alternately take stones from one or more piles, subject to:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        the total number of stones taken is equal to the size of the smallest
        pile before the move;
    </li>

    <li>the move cannot take all the stones from a pile.</li>
</ol>

<p>The player that is unable to move loses.</p>

<p>
    For example, if the piles are of sizes 2, 2 and 4 then there are four
    possible moves. $$ (2,2,4)\xrightarrow{(1,1,0)}(1,1,4)\quad
    (2,2,4)\xrightarrow{(1,0,1)}(1,2,3)\quad
    (2,2,4)\xrightarrow{(0,1,1)}(2,1,3)\quad
    (2,2,4)\xrightarrow{(0,0,2)}(2,2,2)$$
</p>

<p>
    Let $t(n)$ be the smallest nonnegative integer $k$ such that the position
    with $n$ piles of $n$ stones and a single pile of $n+k$ stones is losing for
    the first player assuming optimal play. For example, $t(1) = t(2) = 0$ and
    $t(3) = 2$.
</p>

<p>
    Define $\displaystyle S(N) = \sum_{n=1}^{2^N} t(n)$. You are given $S(10) =
    361522$.
</p>

<p>Find $S(10^4)$. Give your answer modulo $900497239$.</p>
