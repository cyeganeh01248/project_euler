For example, if the passcode was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be: 317.</p>
<p>The text file, <a href="resources/documents/0079_keylog.txt">keylog.txt</a>, contains fifty successful login attempts.</p>
<p>Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse the file so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of unknown length.</p>
