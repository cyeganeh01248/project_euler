<strong>Bozo sort</strong>, not to be confused with the slightly less efficient <strong>bogo sort</strong>, consists out of checking if the input sequence is sorted and if not swapping randomly two elements. This is repeated until eventually the sequence is sorted.
</p>
<p>
If we consider all permutations of the first $4$ natural numbers as input the expectation value of the number of swaps, averaged over all $4!$ input sequences is $24.75$.<br>
The already sorted sequence takes $0$ steps. 
</p>
<p>
In this problem we consider the following variant on bozo sort.<br>
If the sequence is not in order we pick three elements at random and shuffle these three elements randomly.<br>
All $3!=6$ permutations of those three elements are equally likely. <br>
The already sorted sequence will take $0$ steps.<br>
If we consider all permutations of the first $4$ natural numbers as input the expectation value of the number of shuffles, averaged over all $4!$ input sequences is $27.5$. <br>
Consider as input sequences the permutations of the first $11$ natural numbers.<br>
Averaged over all $11!$ input sequences, what is the expected number of shuffles this sorting algorithm will perform?

Give your answer rounded to the nearest integer.
