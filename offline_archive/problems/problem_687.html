Let us call a rank <dfn>perfect</dfn> if no two cards of that same rank appear next to each other after the shuffle.</p>
<p>
It can be seen that the expected number of ranks that are perfect after a random shuffle equals $\frac {4324} {425} \approx 10.1741176471$.</p>
<p>
Find the probability that the number of perfect ranks is prime. Give your answer rounded to $10$ decimal places.</p>
