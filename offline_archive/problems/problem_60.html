<h1>Problem 60</h1>
<p>
    The primes $3$, $7$, $109$, and $673$, are quite remarkable. By taking any
    two primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be
    prime. For example, taking $7$ and $109$, both $7109$ and $1097$ are prime.
    The sum of these four primes, $792$, represents the lowest sum for a set of
    four primes with this property.

<p>
    Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes
    concatenate to produce another prime.
