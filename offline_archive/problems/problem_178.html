It can be seen that each pair of consecutive digits of $45656$ has a difference of one.<br>
A number for which every pair of consecutive digits has a difference of one is called a step number.<br>
A pandigital number  contains every decimal digit from $0$ to $9$ at least once.<br>

How many pandigital step numbers less than $10^{40}$ are there?
