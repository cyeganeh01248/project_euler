<p>We shall consider fractions like, $30/50 = 3/5$, to be trivial examples.</p>
<p>There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.</p>
<p>If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.</p>
