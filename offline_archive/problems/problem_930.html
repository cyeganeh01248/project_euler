<h1>Problem 930</h1>
<p>
    Given $n\ge 2$ bowls arranged in a circle, $m\ge 2$ balls are distributed
    amongst them.
</p>

<p>
    Initially the balls are distributed randomly: for each ball, a bowl is
    chosen equiprobably and independently of the other balls. After this is
    done, we start the following process:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Choose one of the $m$ balls equiprobably at random.</li>
    <li>
        Choose a direction to move - either clockwise or anticlockwise - again
        equiprobably at random.
    </li>
    <li>
        Move the chosen ball to the neighbouring bowl in the chosen direction.
    </li>
    <li>Return to step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    This process stops when all the $m$ balls are located in the same bowl. Note
    that this may be after zero steps, if the balls happen to have been
    initially distributed all in the same bowl.
</p>

<p>
    Let $F(n, m)$ be the expected number of times we move a ball before the
    process stops. For example, $F(2, 2) = \frac{1}{2}$, $F(3, 2) =
    \frac{4}{3}$, $F(2, 3) = \frac{9}{4}$, and $F(4, 5) = \frac{6875}{24}$.
</p>

<p>
    Let $G(N, M) = \sum_{n=2}^N \sum_{m=2}^M F(n, m)$. For example, $G(3, 3) =
    \frac{137}{12}$ and $G(4, 5) = \frac{6277}{12}$. You are also given that
    $G(6, 6) \approx 1.681521567954e4$ in scientific format with 12 significant
    digits after the decimal point.
</p>

<p>
    Find $G(12, 12)$. Give your answer in scientific format with 12 significant
    digits after the decimal point.
