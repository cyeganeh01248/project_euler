Define $M(n)$ to be the minimum number of matchsticks needed to represent the number $n$.</p>

<p>
A number can be represented in digit form or as an expression involving addition and/or multiplication. Also order of operations must be followed, that is multiplication binding tighter than addition. Any other symbols or operations, such as brackets, subtraction, division or exponentiation, are not allowed.</p>

<p>
The valid digits and symbols are shown below:</p>

<p>
For example, $28$ needs $12$ matchsticks to represent it in digit form but representing it as $4\times 7$ would only need $9$ matchsticks and as there is no way using fewer matchsticks $M(28) = 9$.</p>

<p>
Define $\displaystyle T(N) = \sum_{n=1}^N M(n)$. You are given $T(100) = 916$.</p>

<p>
Find $T(10^6)$.</p>
