Three epistemologists, known as A, B, and C, are in a room, each wearing a hat with a number on it. They have been informed beforehand that all three numbers are positive and that one of the numbers is the sum of the other two.</p>

<p>
Once in the room, they can see the numbers on each other's hats but not on their own. Starting with A and proceeding cyclically, each epistemologist must either honestly state "I don't know my number" or announce "Now I know my number!" which terminates the game.</p>

<p>
For instance, if their numbers are $A=2, B=1, C=1$ then A declares "Now I know" at the first turn. If their numbers are $A=2, B=7, C=5$ then "I don't know" is heard four times before B finally declares "Now I know" at the fifth turn.</p>

<p>
Let $F(A,B,C)$ be the number of turns it takes until an epistemologist declares "Now I know", including the turn this declaration is made. So $F(2,1,1)=1$ and $F(2,7,5)=5$.</p>

<p>
Find $\displaystyle \sum_{a=1}^7 \sum_{b=1}^{19} F(a^b, b^a, a^b + b^a)$.</p>
