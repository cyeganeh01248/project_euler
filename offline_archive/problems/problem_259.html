<h1>Problem 259</h1>
<p>
    A positive integer will be called <dfn>reachable</dfn> if it can result from
    an arithmetic expression obeying the following rules:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Uses the digits $1$ through $9$, in that order and exactly once each.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any successive digits can be concatenated (for example, using the digits
        $2$, $3$ and $4$ we obtain the number $234$).
    </li>
    <li>
        Only the four usual binary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,
        multiplication and division) are allowed.
    </li>
    <li>Each operation can be used any number of times, or not at all.</li>
    <li>
        <strong class="tooltip"
            >Unary minus<span class="tooltiptext"
                >A minus sign applied to a single operand (as opposed to a
                subtraction operator between two operands)</span
            ></strong
        >
        is not allowed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any number of (possibly nested) parentheses may be used to define the
        order of operations.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For example, $42$ is reachable, since $(1 / 23) \times ((4 \times 5) - 6)
    \times (78 - 9) = 42$.
</p>

<p>What is the sum of all positive reachable integers?</p>
