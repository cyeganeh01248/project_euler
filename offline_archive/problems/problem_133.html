<h1>Problem 133</h1>
<p>
    A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define
    $R(k)$ to be a repunit of length $k$; for example, $R(6) = 111111$.
</p>
<p>Let us consider repunits of the form $R(10^n)$.</p>
<p>
    Although $R(10)$, $R(100)$, or $R(1000)$ are not divisible by $17$,
    $R(10000)$ is divisible by $17$. Yet there is no value of $n$ for which
    $R(10^n)$ will divide by $19$. In fact, it is remarkable that $11$, $17$,
    $41$, and $73$ are the only four primes below one-hundred that can be a
    factor of $R(10^n)$.
</p>
<p>
    Find the sum of all the primes below one-hundred thousand that will never be
    a factor of $R(10^n)$.
