<h1>Problem 641</h1>
<p>Consider a row of $n$ dice all showing 1.</p>

<p>
    First turn every second die,$ (2,4,6,\ldots)$, so that the number showing is
    increased by 1. Then turn every third die. The sixth die will now show a 3.
    Then turn every fourth die and so on until every $n$th die (only the last
    die) is turned. If the die to be turned is showing a 6 then it is changed to
    show a 1.
</p>

<p>
    Let $f(n)$ be the number of dice that are showing a 1 when the process
    finishes. You are given $f(100)=2$ and $f(10^8) = 69$.
</p>

<p>Find $f(10^{36})$.</p>
