<h1>Problem 354</h1>
<p>
    Consider a honey bee's honeycomb where each cell is a perfect regular
    hexagon with side length $1$.
</p>

<div align="center">
    <img
        src="project/images/p354_bee_honeycomb.png"
        alt="p354_bee_honeycomb.png"
    />
</div>

<p>
    One particular cell is occupied by the queen bee.<br />
    For a positive real number $L$, let $\text{B}(L)$ count the cells with
    distance $L$ from the queen bee cell (all distances are measured from centre
    to centre); you may assume that the honeycomb is large enough to accommodate
    for any distance we wish to consider. <br />
    For example, $\text{B}(\sqrt 3)=6$, $\text{B}(\sqrt {21}) = 12$ and
    $\text{B}(111\,111\,111) = 54$.
</p>

<p>
    Find the number of $L \le 5 \times 10^{11}$ such that $\text{B}(L) = 450$.
</p>
