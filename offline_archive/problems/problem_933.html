Starting with one piece of integer-sized rectangle paper, two players make moves in turn.<br>
A valid move consists of choosing one piece of paper and cutting it <b>both</b> horizontally and vertically, so that it becomes four pieces of smaller rectangle papers, all of which are integer-sized.<br>
The player that does not have a valid move loses the game.</p>

<p>
Let $C(w, h)$ be the number of winning moves for the first player, when the original paper has size $w \times h$. For example, $C(5,3)=4$, with the four winning moves shown below.</p>

<p>
Also write $\displaystyle D(W, H) = \sum_{w = 2}^W\sum_{h = 2}^H C(w, h)$. You are given that $D(12, 123) = 327398$.</p>

<p>
Find $D(123, 1234567)$.</p>
