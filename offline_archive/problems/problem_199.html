<h1>Problem 199</h1>
<p>
    Three circles of equal radius are placed inside a larger circle such that
    each pair of circles is tangent to one another and the inner circles do not
    overlap. There are four uncovered "gaps" which are to be filled iteratively
    with more tangent circles.
</p>
<div class="center">
    <img
        src="resources/images/0199_circles_in_circles.gif?1678992055"
        class="dark_img"
        alt=""
    />
</div>
<p>
    At each iteration, a maximally sized circle is placed in each gap, which
    creates more gaps for the next iteration. After $3$ iterations (pictured),
    there are $108$ gaps and the fraction of the area which is not covered by
    circles is $0.06790342$, rounded to eight decimal places.
</p>
<p>
    What fraction of the area is not covered by circles after $10$
    iterations?<br />
    Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places using the format x.xxxxxxxx
    .
