<h1>Problem 87</h1>
<p>
    The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube,
    and prime fourth power is $28$. In fact, there are exactly four numbers
    below fifty that can be expressed in such a way:
</p>
\begin{align} 28 &amp;= 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4\\ 33 &amp;= 3^2 + 2^3 + 2^4\\ 49 &amp;=
5^2 + 2^3 + 2^4\\ 47 &amp;= 2^2 + 3^3 + 2^4 \end{align}
<p>
    How many numbers below fifty million can be expressed as the sum of a prime
    square, prime cube, and prime fourth power?
