A graph is made up of vertices and coloured edges. 
Between every two distinct vertices there must be exactly one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A red directed edge one way, and a blue directed edge the other way</li>
<li>A green undirected edge</li>
<li>A brown undirected edge</li>
</ul>

Such a graph is called <i>beautiful</i> if 

<ul>
<li>A cycle of edges contains a red edge <b>if and only if</b> it also contains a blue edge</li>
<li>No triangle of edges is made up of entirely green or entirely brown edges</li>
</ul>

<p>
Below are four distinct examples of beautiful graphs on three vertices:

Below are four examples of graphs that are not beautiful:</p>

<p>
Let $G(n)$ be the number of beautiful graphs on the labelled vertices: $1,2,\ldots,n$.
You are given $G(3)=24$, $G(4)=186$ and $G(15)=12472315010483328$.</p>

<p>
Find $G(10^7)$. Give your answer modulo $10^9+7$.</p>
