This problem involves an iterative procedure that begins with a circle of $n\ge 3$ integers. At each step every number is simultaneously replaced with the absolute difference of its two neighbours.</p>

<p>
For any initial values, the procedure eventually becomes periodic.</p>

<p>
Let $S(N)$ be the sum of all possible periods for $3\le n \leq N$. For example, $S(6) = 6$, because the possible periods for $3\le n \leq 6$ are $1, 2, 3$. Specifically, $n=3$ and $n=4$ can each have period $1$ only, while $n=5$ can have period $1$ or $3$, and $n=6$ can have period $1$ or $2$.</p>

<p>
You are also given $S(30) = 20381$.</p>

<p>
Find $S(100)$.</p>
