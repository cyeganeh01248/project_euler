<h1>Problem 896</h1>
<p>
    A contiguous range of positive integers is called a
    <dfn>divisible range</dfn> if all the integers in the range can be arranged
    in a row such that the $n$-th term is a multiple of $n$.<br />
    For example, the range $[6..9]$ is a divisible range because we can arrange
    the numbers as $7,6,9,8$.<br />
    In fact, it is the $4$th divisible range of length $4$, the first three
    being $[1..4], [2..5], [3..6]$.

<p>
    Find the $36$th divisible range of length $36$.<br />
    Give as answer the smallest number in the range.
