$U(a,b)_k$ is the smallest integer greater than $U(a,b)_{k - 1}$ which can be written in exactly one way as the sum of two distinct previous members of $U(a,b)$.</p>
<p>For example, the sequence $U(1,2)$ begins with<br>
$1$, $2$, $3 = 1 + 2$, $4 = 1 + 3$, $6 = 2 + 4$, $8 = 2 + 6$, $11 = 3 + 8$;<br>
$5$ does not belong to it because $5 = 1 + 4 = 2 + 3$ has two representations as the sum of two previous members, likewise $7 = 1 + 6 = 3 + 4$.</p>
<p>Find $\sum\limits_{n = 2}^{10} U(2,2n+1)_k$, where $k = 10^{11}$.</p>
