<p>If all the numbers from $1$ to $1000$ (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used? </p>
<br><p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, $342$ (three hundred and forty-two) contains $23$ letters and $115$ (one hundred and fifteen) contains $20$ letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.</p>
