In this problem we consider triangles drawn on a <b>hexagonal lattice</b>, where each lattice point in the plane has six neighbouring points equally spaced around it, all distance $1$ away.</p>

<p>
We call a triangle <i>remarkable</i> if</p>
<ul>
<li>All three vertices and its <b>incentre</b> lie on lattice points</li>
<li>At least one of its angles is $60^\circ$</li>
</ul>

<p>
Above are four examples of remarkable triangles, with $60^\circ$ angles illustrated in red. Triangles A and B have inradius $1$; C has inradius $\sqrt{3}$; D has inradius $2$.</p>

<p>
Define $T(r)$ to be the number of remarkable triangles with inradius $\le r$. Rotations and reflections, such as triangles A and B above, are counted separately; however direct translations are not. That is, the same triangle drawn in different positions of the lattice is only counted once.</p>

<p>
You are given $T(0.5)=2$, $T(2)=44$, and $T(10)=1302$.</p>

<p>
Find $T(10^6)$.</p>
