In fact most numbers can be expressed as a sum of three triangular numbers in several ways.</p>
<p>
Let $G(n)$ be the number of ways of expressing $n$ as the sum of three triangular numbers, regarding different arrangements of the terms of the sum as distinct.</p>
<p>
For example, $G(9) = 7$, as $9$ can be expressed as: $3+3+3$, $0+3+6$, $0+6+3$, $3+0+6$, $3+6+0$, $6+0+3$, $6+3+0$.<br>  
You are given $G(1000) = 78$ and $G(10^6) = 2106$.</p>
<p>
Find $G(17526 \times 10^9)$.</p>
