<h1>Problem 189</h1>
<p>Consider the following configuration of $64$ triangles:</p>

<div class="center">
    <img
        src="resources/images/0189_grid.gif?1678992055"
        class="dark_img"
        alt=""
    />
</div>

<p>
    We wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours:
    red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same
    colour. Such a colouring shall be called valid. Here, two triangles are said
    to be neighbouring if they share an edge.<br />
    Note: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.
</p>

<p>For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:</p>
<div class="center">
    <img
        src="resources/images/0189_colours.gif?1678992055"
        class="dark_img"
        alt=""
    />
</div>

<p>
    A colouring $C^\prime$ which is obtained from a colouring $C$ by rotation or
    reflection is considered <i>distinct</i> from $C$ unless the two are
    identical.
</p>

<p>How many distinct valid colourings are there for the above configuration?</p>
