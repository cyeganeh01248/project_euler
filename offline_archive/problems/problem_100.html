<p>The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly $50\%$ chance of taking two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs.</p>
<p>By finding the first arrangement to contain over $10^{12} = 1\,000\,000\,000\,000$ discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.</p>
