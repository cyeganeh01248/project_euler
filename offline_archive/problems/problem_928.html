<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cribbage">Cribbage</a>.</p>

<p>
Consider a normal pack of $52$ cards. A Hand is a selection of one or more of these cards.</p>

<p>
For each Hand the <i>Hand score</i> is the sum of the values of the cards in the Hand where the value of Aces is $1$ and the value of court cards (Jack, Queen, King) is $10$.</p>

<p>
The <i>Cribbage score</i> is obtained for a Hand by adding together the scores for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Pairs. A pair is two cards of the same rank. Every pair is worth $2$ points.</li>

<li>
Runs. A run is a set of at least $3$ cards whose ranks are consecutive, e.g. 9, 10, Jack. Note that Ace is never high, so Queen, King, Ace is <b>not</b> a valid run. The number of points for each run is the size of the run. All locally maximum runs are counted. For example, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 the two runs of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7, 8, 9 are counted but not 2, 3, 4 or 3, 4, 5.</li>

<li>
Fifteens. A fifteen is a combination of cards that has value adding to $15$. Every fifteen is worth $2$ points. For this purpose the value of the cards is the same as in the Hand Score.</li></ul>

<p>
For example, $(5 \spadesuit, 5 \clubsuit, 5 \diamondsuit, K \heartsuit)$ has a Cribbage score of $14$ as there are four ways that fifteen can be made and also three pairs can be made.</p>

<p>
The example $( A \diamondsuit, A \heartsuit, 2 \clubsuit, 3 \heartsuit, 4 \clubsuit, 5 \spadesuit)$ has a Cribbage score of $16$: two runs of five worth $10$ points, two ways of getting fifteen worth $4$ points and one pair worth $2$ points. In this example the Hand score is equal to the Cribbage score.</p>

<p>
Find the number of Hands in a normal pack of cards where the Hand score is equal to the Cribbage score.</p>
