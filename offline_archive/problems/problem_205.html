<h1>Problem 205</h1>
<p>
    Peter has nine four-sided (pyramidal) dice, each with faces numbered $1, 2,
    3, 4$.<br />
    Colin has six six-sided (cubic) dice, each with faces numbered $1, 2, 3, 4,
    5, 6$.
</p>

<p>
    Peter and Colin roll their dice and compare totals: the highest total wins.
    The result is a draw if the totals are equal.
</p>

<p>
    What is the probability that Pyramidal Peter beats Cubic Colin? Give your
    answer rounded to seven decimal places in the form 0.abcdefg.
