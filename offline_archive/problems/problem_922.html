<h1>Problem 922</h1>
<p>
    A <strong>Young diagram</strong> is a finite collection of (equally-sized)
    squares in a grid-like arrangement of rows and columns, such that
</p>
<ul>
    <li>the left-most squares of all rows are aligned vertically;</li>
    <li>the top squares of all columns are aligned horizontally;</li>
    <li>the rows are non-increasing in size as we move top to bottom;</li>
    <li>the columns are non-increasing in size as we move left to right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two examples of Young diagrams are shown below.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">

    />
</div>
<p>
    Two players Right and Down play a game on several Young diagrams, all
    disconnected from each other. Initially, a token is placed in the top-left
    square of each diagram. Then they take alternating turns, starting with
    Right. On Right's turn, Right selects a token on one diagram and moves it
    <b>any number of squares</b> to the right. On Down's turn, Down selects a
    token on one diagram and moves it <b>any number of squares</b> downwards. A
    player unable to make a legal move on their turn loses the game.
</p>

<p>
    For $a,b,k\geq 1$ we define an <dfn>$(a,b,k)$-staircase</dfn> to be the
    Young diagram where the bottom-right frontier consists of $k$
    <dfn>steps</dfn> of vertical height $a$ and horizontal length $b$. Shown
    below are four examples of staircases with $(a,b,k)$ respectively $(1,1,4),$
    $(5,1,1),$ $(3,3,2),$ $(2,4,3)$.

        alt="0922_youngs_game_staircases.png"
    />
</div>
<p>
    Additionally, define the <dfn>weight</dfn> of an $(a,b,k)$-staircase to be
    $a+b+k$.
</p>

<p>
    Let $R(m, w)$ be the number ways of choosing $m$ staircases, each having
    weight not exceeding $w$, upon which Right (moving first in the game) will
    win the game assuming optimal play. Different orderings of the same set of
    staircases are to be counted separately.
</p>

<p>
    For example, $R(2, 4)=7$ is illustrated below, with tokens as grey circles
    drawn in their initial positions.

    />
</div>

<p>You are also given $R(3, 9)=314104$.</p>

<p>Find $R(8, 64)$ giving your answer modulo $10^9+7$.</p>
