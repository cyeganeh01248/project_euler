Odd and Even are playing a game with $N$ cookies.</p>

<p>
The game begins with the $N$ cookies divided into one or more piles, not necessarily of the same size. They then make moves in turn, starting with Odd.<br>
Odd's turn: Odd may choose any pile with an <b>odd</b> number of cookies, eat one and divide the remaining (if any) into two equal piles.<br>
Even's turn: Even may choose any pile with an <b>even</b> number of cookies, eat two of them and divide the remaining (if any) into two equal piles.<br>
The player that does not have a valid move loses the game.</p>

<p>
Let $C(N)$ be the number of ways that $N$ cookies can be divided so that Even has a winning strategy.<br>
For example, $C(5) = 2$ because there are two winning configurations for Even: a single pile containing all five cookies; three piles containing one, two and two cookies.<br>
You are also given $C(16) = 64$.</p>

<p>
Find $C(300)$.</p>
