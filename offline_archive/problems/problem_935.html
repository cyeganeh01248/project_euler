<h1>Problem 935</h1>
<p>
    A square of side length $b&lt;1$ is rolling around the inside of a larger
    square of side length $1$, always touching the larger square but without
    sliding.<br />
    Initially the two squares share a common corner. At each step, the small
    square rotates clockwise about a corner that touches the large square, until
    another of its corners touches the large square. Here is an illustration of
    the first three steps for $b = \frac5{13}$.

<p>
    For some values of $b$, the small square may return to its initial position
    after several steps. For example, when $b = \frac12$, this happens in $4$
    steps; and for $b = \frac5{13}$ it happens in $24$ steps.
</p>

<p>
    Let $F(N)$ be the number of different values of $b$ for which the small
    square first returns to its initial position within at most $N$ steps. For
    example, $F(6) = 4$, with the corresponding $b$ values: $$\frac12,\quad 2 -
    \sqrt 2,\quad 2 + \sqrt 2 - \sqrt{2 + 4\sqrt2},\quad 8 - 5\sqrt2 + 4\sqrt3 -
    3\sqrt6,$$ the first three in $4$ steps and the last one in $6$ steps. Note
    that it does not matter whether the small square returns to its original
    <b>orientation</b>.<br />
    Also $F(100) = 805$.

<p>Find $F(10^8)$.</p>
