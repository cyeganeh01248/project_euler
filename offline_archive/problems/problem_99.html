<h1>Problem 99</h1>
<p>
    Comparing two numbers written in index form like $2^{11}$ and $3^7$ is not
    difficult, as any calculator would confirm that $2^{11} = 2048 \lt 3^7 =
    2187$.
</p>
<p>
    However, confirming that $632382^{518061} \gt 519432^{525806}$ would be much
    more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

    click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand
    lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number
    has the greatest numerical value.
