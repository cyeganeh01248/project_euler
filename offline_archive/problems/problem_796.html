However, modern decks have two additional Jokers, which neither have a suit nor a rank, for a total of $54$ cards. If we shuffle such a deck and draw cards without replacement, then we would need, on average, approximately $29.05361725$ cards so that we have at least one card for each rank.</p>

<p>Now, assume you have $10$ such decks, each with a different back design. We shuffle all $10 \times 54$ cards together and draw cards without replacement. What is the expected number of cards needed so every suit, rank and deck design have at least one card?</p>

<p>Give your answer rounded to eight places after the decimal point.</p>
