Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.</p>
<p>For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth $3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53$, is the $938$th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of $938 \times 53 = 49714$.</p>
<p>What is the total of all the name scores in the file?</p>
