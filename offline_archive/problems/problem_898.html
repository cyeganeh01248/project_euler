<h1>Problem 898</h1>
<p>
    Claire Voyant is a teacher playing a game with a class of students. A fair
    coin is tossed on the table. All the students can see the outcome of the
    toss, but Claire cannot. Each student then tells Claire whether the outcome
    is head or tail. The students may lie, but Claire knows the probability that
    each individual student lies. Moreover, the students lie independently.
    After that, Claire attempts to guess the outcome using an optimal strategy.
</p>
<p>
    For example, for a class of four students with lying probabilities
    $20\%,40\%,60\%,80\%$, Claire guesses correctly with probability 0.832.
</p>
<p>
    Find the probability that Claire guesses correctly for a class of 51
    students each lying with a probability of $25\%, 26\%, \dots, 75\%$
    respectively.
</p>
<p>Give your answer rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.</p>
