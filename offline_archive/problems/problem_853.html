<h1>Problem 853</h1>
<p>
    For every positive integer $n$ the Fibonacci sequence modulo $n$ is
    periodic. The period depends on the value of $n$. This period is called the
    <strong>Pisano period</strong> for $n$, often shortened to $\pi(n)$.
</p>
<p>
    There are three values of $n$ for which $\pi(n)$ equals $18$: $19$, $38$ and
    $76$. The sum of those smaller than $50$ is $57$.
</p>
<p>
    Find the sum of the values of $n$ smaller than $1\,000\,000\,000$ for which
    $\pi(n)$ equals $120$.
