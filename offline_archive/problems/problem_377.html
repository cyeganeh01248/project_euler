<h1>Problem 377</h1>
<p>
    There are $16$ positive integers that do not have a zero in their digits and
    that have a digital sum equal to $5$, namely: <br />
    $5$, $14$, $23$, $32$, $41$, $113$, $122$, $131$, $212$, $221$, $311$,
    $1112$, $1121$, $1211$, $2111$ and $11111$.<br />
    Their sum is $17891$.
</p>
<p>
    Let $f(n)$ be the sum of all positive integers that do not have a zero in
    their digits and have a digital sum equal to $n$.
</p>
<p>
    Find $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{17} f(13^i)$.<br />
    Give the last $9$ digits as your answer.
