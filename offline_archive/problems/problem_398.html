<h1>Problem 398</h1>
<p>
    Inside a rope of length $n$, $n - 1$ points are placed with distance $1$
    from each other and from the endpoints. Among these points, we choose $m -
    1$ points at random and cut the rope at these points to create $m$ segments.
</p>
<p>
    Let $E(n, m)$ be the expected length of the second-shortest segment. For
    example, $E(3, 2) = 2$ and $E(8, 3) = 16/7$. Note that if multiple segments
    have the same shortest length the length of the second-shortest segment is
    defined as the same as the shortest length.
</p>
<p>
    Find $E(10^7, 100)$. Give your answer rounded to $5$ decimal places behind
    the decimal point.
